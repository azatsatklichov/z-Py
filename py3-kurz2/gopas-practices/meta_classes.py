Metaclasses

	A metaclass is to a class what a class is to an instance; that is, a
metaclass is used to create classes, just as classes are used to create
instances. And just as we can ask whether an instance belongs to a
class by using isinstance(), we can ask whether a class object (such as
dict, int, or SortedList) inherits another class using issubclass().

 	One use of metaclasses is to provide both a promise and a guarantee
about a classâ€™s API. Another use is to modify a class in some way (like
a class decorator does). And of course, metaclasses can be used for
both purposes at the same time.
