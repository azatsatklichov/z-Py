Anaconda Navigator
Anaconda Navigator is a desktop graphical user interface (GUI) included in Anaconda distribution that allows you to launch applications and manage conda packages, environments and channels without using command-line commands. Navigator can search for packages on Anaconda Cloud or in a local Anaconda Repository, install them in an environment, run the packages and update them. It is available for Windows, macOS and Linux.

Navigator is automatically installed when you install Anaconda version 4.0.0 or higher.

The following applications are available by default in Navigator [10]:

JupyterLab
Jupyter Notebook
QTConsole
Spyder
VSCode
Glueviz
Orange 3 App
Rodeo
RStudio


Conda
Conda is an open source,[11] cross-platform,[12] language-agnostic[13] package manager and environment management system[14][15][16] that installs, runs, and updates packages and their dependencies.[11] Conda allows users to:

install different versions of binary software packages and any required libraries appropriate for their computing platform
switch between package versions
download and install updates from a software repository.
It was created for Python programs, but it can package and distribute software for any language (e.g., R), including multi-language projects.[13]

The conda package and environment manager is included in all versions of Anaconda, Miniconda[17] and Anaconda Repository[7].
